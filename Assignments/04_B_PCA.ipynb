    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color='red'>We have split Assignment 4 into two parts to make it easier for you to work on them separately and for the markers to give you feedback. This is part B of Assignment 4 and deals with the MNIST Dataset - Part A deals with the 20 Newsgroup dataset. Both Assignments together are still worth 50% of CourseWork 2. **Remember to submit both notebooks (you can submit them separately).**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation: **in questions where this is specified, you will be penalised if you go over.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to distinguish between **attributes** (columns of the data) and **features** (which typically refers only to the independent variables, i.e. excluding the target variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you must NOT borrow actual text or code from others. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any). Please refer to the [Academic Misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct) page for what consistutes a breach of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 22/11/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file(s) again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.**: This Assignment requires submitting **two files (electronically as described below)**:\n",
    " 1. The Jupyter Notebook for Part A, *and*\n",
    " 1. This Jupyter Notebook for Part B\n",
    " \n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook (as well as Part A), making sure to:\n",
    "   1. save it with **all code/text and visualisations**: markers are NOT expected to run any cells,\n",
    "   1. keep the name of the file **UNCHANGED**, *and*\n",
    "   1. **keep the same structure**: retain the questions, **DO NOT** delete any cells and **avoid** adding unnecessary cells unless absolutely necessary, as this makes the job harder for the markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit it using the `submit` functionality. To do this, you must be on a DICE environment. Open a Terminal, and:\n",
    "   1. **On-Campus Students**: navigate to the location of this notebook and execute the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      ```submit iaml cw2 04_A_KMeans.ipynb 04_B_PCA.ipynb```\n",
    "      \n",
    "   1. **Distance Learners:** These instructions also apply to those students who work on their own computer. First you need to copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command). For this, you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example. Replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details: i.e. if your student number is for example s1234567, then `[YOUR USERNAME]` becomes `s1234567`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 04_A_KMeans.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:04_A_KMeans.ipynb\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 04_B_PCA.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:04_B_PCA.ipynb\n",
    "    ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "    ssh student.login\n",
    "    submit iaml cw2 04_A_KMeans.ipynb 04_B_PCA.ipynb\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "   What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You should receive an automatic email confirmation after submission.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%. Both Part A and Part B (this notebook) are each worth 50% of the Total Mark for Assignment 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(a)** [Code] Using SKLearn's `PCA` object, transform the MNIST `data` into orthogonal (PCA) components, retaining **all** dimensions (set `n_components` appropriately). Set `svd_solver='full'` and keep all other parameters at default values. Then plot the *percentage* variance explained by each dimension as a `bar`-graph, in descending order of variance. *Hint: see the `explained_variance_ratio_` attribute of the PCA object.* On the same graph, plot (line) the cumululative explained variance as you add components (again in descending order of variance explained). Indicate the point at which 80% of the variance is explained (e.g. using matplotlib's [`vlines()`](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.vlines.html)): label the number of components at this point (e.g. in the Legend). Make sure to distinguish between the plots and label them appropriately.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;*Tip: you may need to use [`twinx()`](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.3/gallery/api/two_scales.html#sphx-glr-gallery-api-two-scales-py) to better combine the two plots. Also, for consistency, number components starting from 0.* <br>\n",

Also plot the mean value. *Hint: You should have 4 figures. Use the `components_`/`mean_` attributes of the `PCA` object you created.* <br>\n",

    "### ========== Question 2.3 --- [14 marks] ==========\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to explore what these principal components (eigen-vectors) capture about the data. To do this, we will first project the data onto the PCA space, and then reconstruct it using successively more dimensions (eigen-vectors). To save us time, we will do this for the first image (`digits.data[0,:]`) which should itself be a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(a)** [Code] Let us first verify that PCA is indeed an invertible transform. Using heatmaps similarly to the previous question, display the original digit. Using the PCA object's `transform` method, project this into the PCA space, and then reconstruct the original digit by multiplying each dimension with the projection value. Show the reconstructed digit, and also print the Mean Absolute Differences (MAD) between the two. *Tip: the MAD should be 0 - if it is not, you may be forgetting to add something...* Label everything appropriately.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Hint: the PCA `transform` requires a 2D array, with the samples along the rows...*<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(b)** [Code] Now we can analyse the quality of the reconstruction as we include more components. For the same digit, plot the reconstruction with `[0, 1, 2, 5, 15, 30]` components. For each reconstruction, compute and print (within the plot title) the MAD between the reconstruction and the original value.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(c)** [Text] Comment on the observations in the figures. How many components does it take to reconstruct the digit in a way that it is recogniseable?"

    "We will now investigate the effect PCA has on classification performance. Specifically we want to analyse whether the PCA transformation improves the performance of (i) an SVM and (ii) a Naive-Bayes classifier. We will use **5-Fold Cross-Validation** to evaluate our models using the mean accuracy provided by the `score` method of the classifiers in SKLearn. \n",

    "*N.B.: To ensure repeatability, set the `random_state=0` where applicable, and use the same KFold object (`shuffle=True`) throughout.*\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(a)** [Code] Train an SVM classifier ([`SVC`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)) with a linear kernel (keep all other parameters at defaults), first on the raw digit data, and then on the PCA-transformed data, **keeping all components**. Report the mean accuracy over folds in each case.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(b)** [Code] Now train a `NaiveBayes` classifier with default parameters in a similar manner (on raw and PCA-transformed data). Think carefully, and explain using programming comments, about which type of `NaiveBayes` implementation is applicable in this scenario, keeping in mind that we should use the same type for the Raw and PCA training. Again report the fold-averaged accuracy `score`.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(c)** [Text] What effect did PCA have on each of these classifiers? By referring to the theory behind each classifier type, explain why this is."
